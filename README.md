# Hex-Color-Code-Generator
This project generates random hex color code and show the color on the screen. Apart from that I accepts the color as input and give hex code of that color as an output.


# What did I learn from this project ?

1 Creating Hex Color Code using Math.round() function.
2 About toString() function. By default, this function takes one argument which is a base of a number as 10. Which is decimal number. If we want to get binary or octa or hexadecimal number then we need to pass the argument according to that.
3 About the "input" event listener.
4 About Flexbox and its different properties.
